      <h2> Hi, I'm Laurence </h2>
      
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Laurence R. Baylon. I was born on September 5, 2004, in Daet, Camarines Norte, and grew up in Talisay.  
        I’ve always loved anime, video games, and reading manga. These hobbies have influenced my interests and dreams over the years. My love for technology started back in elementary school at Daet Elementary School, where I spent a lot of time exploring computer shops.  
        I went to Moreno Integrated School and later Vinzons Pilot High School. Now, I’m studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Camarines Norte State College.  
        My main goal is to graduate and get a job that’s both rewarding and stable. I live by Confucius’ saying: “It does not matter how slowly you go, as long as you do not stop.” This keeps me going even when things get tough.  
      </p>

        My father's name was Noel Baylon, but he has sadly passed away. My mother, Ligaya Baylon, is the one supporting our family. I am the eldest son, and I have two younger brothers, John Paulo and John Clarence.

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    
     <p>    
       I don't have any experience directly related to my BSIT course, but I've taken on various side jobs to support myself and my family. These include making hollow blocks, selling buko juice, and working as a truck loader. 
    While I don't have a regular job, I always look for sidelines whenever I have the time.
